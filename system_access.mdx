## Logging in

If you have a Google Workspace or Microsoft Outlook account, you can log in using single sign-on. (Note that an organization admin will need to provision an account to your email first.)

If not using single sign-on, you can login using your email address and a one-time password that will be emailed to you or you can set up a password for your account.
